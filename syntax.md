# Harmony Language Syntax

Harmony is a language designed for formal dialectical logic. It provides operators such as thesis, antithesis, and synthesis for solving contradictions.

## Variables
Define variables using the `variable` keyword:

variable X = 10;

## Conditional Statements
Conditional logic uses the `if`, `else` statements:

if (X > 5) { print("X is greater than 5"); } else { print("X is less than or equal to 5"); }

## Operators
- **Thesis**: Represent a proposition or statement.
- **Antithesis**: Represent the opposite or contradiction of the thesis.
- **Synthesis**: Resolves contradictions between thesis and antithesis.

thesis { print("This is the thesis."); } antithesis { print("This is the antithesis."); } synthesis { print("This is the synthesis."); }
