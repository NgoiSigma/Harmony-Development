# Harmony-Development
Language based on Formal Dialectical Logic for resolving contradictions and system analysis
Harmony is a programming language based on Formal Dialectical Logic (FDL), designed for resolving contradictions and performing system analysis. The language integrates unique operators such as thesis, antithesis, synthesis, and analysis, which provide a structured approach to working with complex, contradictory data.

Project Overview
Harmony is developed to handle formal dialectics and logical contradictions, making it suitable for a wide range of applications from AI integration to business automation tools. It offers built-in support for standard programming features like:
Variables and data types
Conditional statements and loops
Built-in libraries for numbers, strings, arrays, and more
Operators for working with dialectics (thesis, antithesis, synthesis)
Main Features
FDL Operators: Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, and analysis for formal dialectics.
Extensible Libraries: Including math operations, string handling, and array management.
Integration with Telegram and OpenAI: Special libraries for bot development and AI-driven solutions.

Installation
To install the Harmony interpreter, follow the steps below:

Linux Installation
1. Open the terminal.
2. Install the Harmony interpreter:
sudo apt install harmony-lang
3. Verify the installation by checking the version:

harmony --version

Install from Source

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/NgoiSigma/harmony-development.git
2. Navigate to the project directory:
cd harmony-development
3. Build and install the interpreter:
make
sudo make install
4. Verify installation:
harmony --version
Usage
Once installed, you can create and run programs with the .hmn extension. Here is an example program:
variable X = 10;
if (X > 5) {
    print("X is greater than 5");
} else {
    print("X is less than or equal to 5");
}

To run the program:
harmony program.hmn
Examples
You can find more examples in the examples/ directory, including:
Basic operations
FDL operators in use (thesis, antithesis, synthesis)
Integration with external services (Telegram, OpenAI)
